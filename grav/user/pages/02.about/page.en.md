I was born in 1982 in Groningen. After having lived in Zwolle and Kampen for five years for my studies in Journalism, I moved to Enschede. I have been living there for the past fourteen years, of which the last four with my wife and two cats.

I like to cook (Indian, Mexican, Thai food) and bake (Dutch apple pie!), and even though I don't have much skill at it I like to be creative in all sorts of ways every now and then.


### Fronteers âœ¨

In addition to my work as a front-end developer, I am chairperson of Fronteers, the trade union for Front-end developers in the Netherlands and Belgium. In this role I have put a lot of energy and attention into the association in order to further develop it into a more visible and diverse association. For example, we are more often present as an association at various conferences.

We are now also a member of the W3C, with which we hope to give web developers in the Netherlands, Belgium and beyond a more direct voice in the development of the web.
In addition, I would like to welcome more developers (of all sorts!) To Fronteers as front-end developers.

The internet is for everyone. I therefore think it is important that internet productions are made by reflecting society. And so that the atmosphere at companies that make productions is open, constructive and diverse.
