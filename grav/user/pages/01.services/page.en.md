I create websites and applications that meet today's standards for companies large and small.

In addition, I also believe it is important to do my bit for a better world wide web. I do this by continuously improving myself in my knowledge of how to build accessible websites. Remember: [The web is for everyone](https://twitter.com/timberners_lee/status/228960085672599552)!

I firmly believe in the _ Girl Scout rule_, a principle according to which you should always leave the code you encounter better than you found it.
