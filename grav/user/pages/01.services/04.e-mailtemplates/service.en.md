If you have a newsletter or special e-mailing to send to your contacts, I can make it extra festive by building you a layout.

For four years I have gained extensive experience in building e-mail templates for Digital Herald (OEMPro) and [Mailchimp] (https://mailchimp.com/).

Creating templates for e-mail campaigns is a job in itself. Front-end development in itself is already a multi-dimensional technical challenge, because you have to take into account screen sizes, devices, different (versions) of browsers. With e-mail template development, additional subject-specific knowledge is involved, because the HTML that you write is a mix of HTML in 2005 and HTML in 2019.

Add to this the fact that different campaign software offers additional options (and limitations), and you've got a challenge I'd love to tackle with you!
