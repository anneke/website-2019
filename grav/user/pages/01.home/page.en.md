I am a front-end developer with a passion for a great user experience.

This is reflected in a specialization in robust and clearly written HTML and CSS, with a strong focus on accessibility and code reusability. (Vanilla) JavaScript is the icing on the cake! üç∞

In addition to my work as a developer, I am also chairperson of [Fronteers] (https://fronteers.nl), the trade union for Front-end developers.
